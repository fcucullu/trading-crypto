# Business case context
I helped to build Xcapit, a UNICEF-backed fintech startup focused on providing financial services through blockchain technology and artificial intelligence. We offered a platform designed to make saving and investing more accessible, particularly for people who are financially excluded or underserved. Xcapit enables users to manage their savings, invest in digital assets (like cryptocurrencies), and leverage AI-driven financial tools.

Xcapit aims to empower users with decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions, often with a social impact angle. The platform integrates with blockchain-based systems to create a transparent and secure environment for managing personal finances. Its mission aligns with promoting financial inclusion, especially in regions where access to traditional banking services is limited.

# Note:
This repo contains only files related to this specific objective and may lack the higher-level engine, as these resources were part of a larger software system I created. The purpose of this repo is not to provide a ready-to-use solution but to demonstrate my ability to build software relevant to its title.
